# Project-1-The-Game-Aliens-Invasion
First Game Project
In the works. 
Stay tuned.

Here's a sneak peek of the project: â–º https://j4code.github.io/Project-1-The-Game-Aliens-Invasion/

Description

Aliens Invasion. This game is played with a player ship and multiple aliens. You have to shoot all of the aliens, so that you can proceed to the next level of the game. The game begins with 3 lives. You lose when the player ship has been shot by the aliens 3 times. This game is still a work in progress in getting the aliens to fire randomly at the players spaceship and fly at the player ship, increasing alien fire power and speed, as you progress to the next level of the game.

The goals

To Build a game that is playable in the browser
Design patterns for the design and implementation of code
Use test-driven design to build a client-side application

Design Approach

The style chosen was inspired by one of my favorite retro games called Galaga.

Technical Approach

We created different files that contain the game's object classes.
Our game logic is in a separate file.

Difficulties

Working on making the aliens fire randomly and frequently, at the players ship, as each level increases.
